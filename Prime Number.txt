PRİME NUMBERS STARTİNG WİTH 5

Algorithm to display all prime numbers with 3 digits starting with 5:

1. Loop through numbers from 500 to 599

2. For each number, check if it is prime:
    a. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
    b. Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.

3. If the number is prime, print it.



def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

for number in range(500, 600):
    if is_prime(number):
        print(number)
